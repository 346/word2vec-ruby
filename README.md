# `word2vec-ruby`

Minor rewrite of, and `ruby` `C`-bindings for, the `distance` program from [`word2vec`](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
This could almost certainly be done with e.g. the [`rb-libsvm`](https://github.com/febeling/rb-libsvm) gem, but this
does so directly.

**N.B.**: This does _not_ currently include bindings for the main `word2vec` program; model creation must be done with
the `C` program. See [the original](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) or a
[fork on GitHub](https://github.com/dav/word2vec) for how to do so.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'word2vec-ruby'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install word2vec-ruby
```

## Usage

Here we assume you already have a model file generated by `word2vec` (e.g. `vector.bin`); if this is not the case, you
should probably start [here](https://github.com/dav/word2vec).

Assuming the model file is at `data/vector.bin`, the following shows some basic usage patterns:

```ruby
require "word2vec/native_model"

# Load the model file.
model = Word2Vec::NativeModel.parse_file("data/vector.bin")

# Get the index of some word in the model's vocabulary:
model.index("cat")
# => 1980

# Get the nearest neighbors for a word:
model.nearest_neighbors(%w(cat), neighbors_count: 3)
# => { "dog" => 0.7418528199195862, "cats" => 0.711361825466156, "puppy" => 0.6765584349632263 }
```
